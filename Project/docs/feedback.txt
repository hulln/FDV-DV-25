* layout, it has to be only one page
- Chrats, especially first, hard to understand
- missing legends
- If average age is high, salary is not seen --> change how you present this, e.g. using two semicircles (up for age, down for salary).
- Too much long texts
-  You write "Rising costs, stagnant wages", but there is no time dimnesion in here
- add annotations (e.g. COVID)
